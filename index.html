  <h2>Nationality Council News Origin</h2>
    <p>The archive titled, “Nationality Council News vol. 21” is about the fiftieth anniversary of the completion of the Nationality Rooms Program in November of 1976. It can be found as a digitized historical newsletter, preserved in the University of Pittsburgh’s Digital Collection, among 102 additional newsletters regarding the Nationality Council. The archive serves as a primary source for becoming more informed of the organization’s activities and priorities, during the time of publication. It is a newsletter published by the Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange and from Nationality Council News. From the University Secretary and Nationality Council Chairman, John Brosky, included is a list of recent events held by the Committees and a schedule of when television specials and articles relating to the anniversary are to be released.

  <h2>50th Aniversary of the Nationality Council</h2>
    <p>There are recent updates and announcements included from each Nationality Room Committee intended to share with members of the National Council. The 21st volume of the National Council Newsletters was originally printed by the National Council under the director of Pitt’s Nationality Rooms and Exchange program, Maxine Bruhns, who recently passed in 2020 after serving for over 50 years, according to The Pitt News and is now digitalized and preserved by the University (O’Donnell, 2020). Recent and upcoming events from each committee are mentioned as well as a new book for the nationality rooms including photos of each room alongside a new map which is advertised and available for sale. Following are the TV specials to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary listed with a full schedule accompanying recent meetings that were held and are listed with notes and explanations. Last, in the newsletter is a full calendar of upcoming events and meetings being held by committees of the nationality rooms. This archive is very similar to others in the collection, the main difference being that this newsletter is mainly focused on the fiftieth anniversary and events celebrating that. It functions as a historical record, so that researchers and students can read and study it to establish what issues and decisions were relevant at the time. It can also offer context for trends, social aspects, and history in organizational terms. In relation to other information in the archive, it fits chronologically into the full publications of the National Council News, so the ideas, policies, and memberships can be seen as evolving over time.

  <h2>What was the Council Doing?</h2>
    <p>This document gives a firsthand account of what the National Council was doing, thinking, and prioritizing during the specified time period. Originally, the nationality rooms were designed to represent cultural heritage but are now used for educational and cultural studies, and according to the University Times, over five million dollars have been raised for exchange programs up to this point (Levine, 2025). Also, through the newsletters, it can depict debates, agendas, concerns, policies, and events that may not be revealed or fully captured in secondary sources. It fills in gaps in decisions and voices that may otherwise go unrecorded and forgotten. Accumulating years of newsletters can help researchers identify trends, conflicts, and developments over the years within the National Council. Having documentation like this can encourage researchers and historians to learn more about the nationality rooms and the Council as it provides data for analysis. It can also aid researchers in understanding how people talked about issues, how stories and ideas have developed over time, how the organization changed (or remained the same), and how it connected to larger social movements and connections. By digitalizing and archiving this newsletter,  it has become more  accessible to students, scholars, and the public and helps reduce barriers and challenges around research. </p>

  <h2>Archive Usage Today</h2>
    <p>This archive can be used to connect with existing knowledge such as comparing the council’s published positions with other government policies and newspaper coverage. It demonstrates that the organization's work fits into larger social and political events such as the civil right movement, women’s rights, or labor struggles and worker’s rights. Information found in the archive can fill in , so there can be a better understanding of the history and events of the National Council. There can be evidence that contradicts today’s consensus about certain topics or recall of events. There can also be analysis on who was given a major voice in history and as compared to  those who were left out and went unnoticed or unrecognized for their contributions and ideas. It also demonstrates how the council framed events and policies and in what ways, questioning how that framing shaped history and how it is remembered. Additional  review of this archive can lead to more research questions such as, what happened to the  people mentioned in the volume, and what impact did they have? How did the council's positions change over time? Was there any major conflict or controversy? Who was represented? Who wasn’t? How can we find other voices on this matter? This archive can be studied in many ways and can branch out into other policies like, education, organization, and public research to further guide students and researchers in their work.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
    <p>Today, many of the archives are used in exhibits to commemorate and celebrate the Council and Nationality Rooms Program at the University, and additionally to encourage students to utilize the archives in research and studies regarding Pitt’s connection with heritage and culture (Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs, n.d.). <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
